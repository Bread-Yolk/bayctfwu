# Basic-mod1
## DESCRIPTION:
We found this weird message being passed around on the servers, we think we have a working decryption scheme. 
Download the message [here](https://github.com/jon-brandy/CTF-WRITE-UP/blob/bc1c3f33cf96e7ec50e563fe8933d516d46f9c41/Asset/Basic-mod1/message.txt). Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase), 
26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore. Wrap your decrypted message in the 
picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
