# morse-code
## DESCRIPTION:
Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this? 
Download the file [here](https://github.com/jon-brandy/CTF-WRITE-UP/blob/d0f6516abf5314fe61b6bd02cc9b719c8ea68a75/Asset/morse-code/morse_chal.wav). Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.
## HINT:
1. Audacity is a really good program to analyze morse code audio.
## STEPS:
1. Try to use this [website](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html), just put the audio files and it will decode the morse-code by itself.
