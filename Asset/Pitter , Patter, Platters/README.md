## DESCRIPTION:
'Suspicious' is written all over this disk image. 
Download [suspicious.dd.sda1]()
## HINTS:
1. It may help to analyze this image in multiple ways: as a blob, and as an actual mounted disk.
2. Have you heard of slack space? There is a certain set of tools that now come with Ubuntu that I'd recommend for examining that disk space phenomenon...
## STEPS:
1. First download the disk given.
2. Next
