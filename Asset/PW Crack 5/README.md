# PW Crack 5
#### Write-up author: [jon-brandy](https://github.com/jon-brandy)
## DESCRIPTION:
Can you crack the password to get the flag? 
Download the password checker [here]() and you'll need the encrypted [flag]() and the [hash]() in the same directory too. 
Here's a [dictionary]() with all possible passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far.
## HINTS:
1. Opening a file in Python is crucial to using the provided dictionary.
2. You may need to trim the whitespace from the dictionary word before hashing. Look up the Python string function, `strip`.
3. The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
## STEPS:
1. First, download all the files given in the same directory.
2. Then open the python code.

```
