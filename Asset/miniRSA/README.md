#### Write-up author: [jon-brandy](https://github.com/jon-brandy)
## DESCRIPTION:
Let's decrypt this: [ciphertext]()? Something seems a bit small.
## HINTS:
1. RSA [tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
2. How could having too small an e affect the security of this 2048 bit key?
3. Make sure you don't lose precision, the numbers are pretty big (besides the e value)
## STEPS:
1. First, download the file given.
2. Next
