# buffer overflow 3
#### Write-up author: [jon-brandy](https://github.com/jon-brandy)
## DESCRIPTION:
Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag?
It looks like Dr. Oswal added a stack canary to this [program]() to protect against buffer overflows. You can view source [here](). 
And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 64367`
## HINT:
1. Maybe there's a smart way to brute-force the canary?
## STEPS:
1. First, download both files given.
2. Next, check the program file.
