# Basic-mod2
## DESCRIPTION:
A new modular challenge! Download the message [here](https://github.com/jon-brandy/CTF-WRITE-UP/blob/295e948fa9ea37bd6b1c73dd24718f146e776576/Asset/Basic-mod2/message.txt). 
Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. 
Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore. 
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
## HINTS:
1. Do you know what the modular inverse is?
2. The inverse modulo z of x is the number, y that when multiplied by x is 1 modulo z.
3. It's recommended to use a tool to find the modular inverses
