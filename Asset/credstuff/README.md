# credstuff
## DESCRIPTION:
We found a leak of a blackmarket website's login credentials. 
Can you find the password of the user `cultiris` and successfully decrypt it? Download the leak [here](https://github.com/jon-brandy/CTF-WRITE-UP/blob/aa4795076e2461d272f9188cc8327ae0ef8885af/Asset/credstuff/leak.tar). 
The first user in `usernames.txt` corresponds to the first password in 
`passwords.txt`. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.
