# substitution2
## DESCRIPTION:
It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. 
The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! 
Can you still crack the cipher? Download the message [here]().
## HINT:
1. Try refining your frequency attack, maybe analyzing groups of letters would improve your results?
## STEPS:
1. First download the file given.
2. Using the same method as challenge `substitution0` and `substitution1`. We just need to paste the text from the `message.txt` file to this [website](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution) and press `decrypt automatically`.
3. Finally we got the flag!
